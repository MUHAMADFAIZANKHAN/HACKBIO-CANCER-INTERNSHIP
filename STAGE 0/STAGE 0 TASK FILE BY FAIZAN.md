**COSMIC, the Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer**

**INTRODUCTION**

The Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer, or COSMIC, compiles the knowledge currently accessible regarding how somatic mutations affect a variety of human cancers.The primary data used in COSMIC are taken directly from scientific literature by highly skilled manual curators who read, analyze, and extract detailed mutation data from journal articles. They also extract any additional information that may be available, such as patient predisposition or environmental factors. Parallel to this extensive manual curation process, a second curation track adds an extensive collection of more focused but larger-scale data from systematic screens, major cancer data portals, supplementary tables, and downloadable files linked to curated papers to COSMIC. Combining data from these two curation strands gives COSMIC an unparalleled coverage breadth and depth, establishing it as the main tool for investigating the mutation landscape and aetiology of human cancer.

**COSMIC CONTENTS**

**Cancer gene census**

COSMIC, the CGC (https\://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/census) aims to catalog all genes causally implicated in cancer through somatic and germline mutations including their role in the etiology of the disease, the kinds of mutations that lead to gene malfunction in cancer, and the kinds of cancer for which mutations are more frequently found.

**COSMIC-3D**

COSMIC-3D is a platform  that helps comprehend cancer mutations in relation to three-dimensional protein structure. Protein missense, in-frame deletion, and nonsense mutations are mapped to the structure and sequence of proteins using COSMIC-3D. Through the SIFTS UniProt-to-PDB mappings , COSMIC mutations are first mapped to UniProt sequences and then to wwPDB  protein structures. The COSMIC-3D web interface (https\://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic3d) provides the data. It enables interactive exploration of cancer mutation data in contexts related to protein sequence and protein structure, making it easier to show, comprehend, and analyze the effects of cancer mutations.

**Downloads**

All COSMIC, Cell Lines Project, CGC and COSMIC-3D information are freely to be had thru their respective web sites. The majority of the tabular information inside web sites can be downloaded as comma- or tab-separated value (CSV/TSV) documents from in the web page itself.
